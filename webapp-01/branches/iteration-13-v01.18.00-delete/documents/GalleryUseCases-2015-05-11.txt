                    gallery exists and there are images in it.

   Expected Result: The page is displayed with a gallery.

                    gallery does not exist.  

   Expected Result: Page is displayed with no gallery.  An error message appears where the gallery
                    should be.

                    gallery does exist, but there are no files in the folder.

   Expected Result: Page is displayed with no gallery.  A message appears where the gallery should
                    be saying that there are no images currently in this gallery.

4. Use Case:        A page is requested for which a gallery is enabled.  The page has been 
                    requested before and the folder didnâ€™t exist or there were no images in it.
                    Now the folder does exist and there are images in it.

                    thumbnail folder for the gallery an IO error occurs (e.g. no permission to 
                    create the folder).

                    gallery should be.
