1. Use Case 1

Request page "cornelia". Successfully retrieved.

Refresh page "cornelia". Successfully retrieved.

Refreshed 10 further times. All 10 successfully retrieved.

2. Use Case 2

Request page "images". Page successfully retrieved.  No gallery displayed. On examination
of DOM the thumbnail gallery contained the text "No images in gallery" as expected.

Refresh page "images". Page successfully retrieved.

Refreshed 10 further times. Web app crashed on first refresh with too many hibernate
sessions.

NOTE: This is probably related to the Exception Handling code put into the Galleries,
which has highlighted that sessions aren't always closed where they should be.  This may
need further investigation.  On a hunch I changed the ScreenBeanManager.getScreen() method
to close the session as soon as the database has been read. This will need more formal
testing but for now let's hope it works.

It didn't!

This is probably because there are other places where sessions are left open.  There are
lots but we haven't seen
