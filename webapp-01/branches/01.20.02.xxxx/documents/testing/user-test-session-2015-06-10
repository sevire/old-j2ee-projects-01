This test session is taking place after spending a lot of time (weeks) trying to track
down the "Too many connections" issue, without success, although the problem has gone
away now and I am assuming that there was some environmental factor which was causing it.

So now I am back to testing the re-factored Gallery functionality.

Refer to GalleryUseCases-2015-05-11.txt for test scenarios.

Use Case 1.

Page:             Exists
Gallery:          Enabled
Gallery Folder:   Exists
Gallery Images:   Exists
Thumbnail Folder: Doesn't Exist
Thumbnail Images: N/A

Expected Result: The page is displayed with a gallery with the right number of images.

Test Screens:
- courtney: 11 images
- helena:   6  images
- cornelia: 7  images

Preparation: Remove all thumbnail folders.
Restart Tomcat.
