This document describes the procedure for getting a live copy of the LDA database into the development environment.
Note that at the time of writing this happens automatically every night through a combination of:

1. A cron job set up on the Oxxus server to take a DB dump (I think at midnight) every day and place in the file:

    /home/thomas/backup/lda_v02.sql

2. A cron job set up on my development laptop which ftp gets this file and then uses mysql to update the database

The purpose of this document is to explain how to do all this manually, if for example changes have been made in the
live environment which need to be reflected in development straight away.  Essentially the procedure is to do manually
what the remote and local cron jobs do automatically.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Take a dump of the live database on the live server

   - Use the sshlda.sh bash script to login to lucifersdarkangel.co.uk using ssh.
   - Use the following command to create the live dump in the right file and location.

    mysqldump -u root -pOC7AaWC77B lda_v02 > /home/thomas/backup/lda_v02.sql

    (Replace user/password with latest if different)

2. On the development server, ftp the file from the remote server to the development server and apply the dump. This can
   achieved in two ways:

   [A] - Using the bash file ftp_live_sqldump.sh (just type in from any terminal session and it should work).
   [B] - Manually

   To Carry out the process manually, take the following steps:

   - On the development machine, ftp get the dump file and put it in an appropriate directory

     ftp lucifersdarkangel.co.uk

   - ftp will respond something like:

     Connected to lucifersdarkangel.co.uk.
     220 (vsFTPd 2.2.2)
     Name (lucifersdarkangel.co.uk:thomassecondary):

   - Type username

     thomas

   - ftp will respond with:

     Password:

   - Type password

     q1w2e3r4t5y6

   - ftp will respond something like:

     230 Login successful.
     Remote system type is UNIX.
     Using binary mode to transfer files.
     ftp>

   - Type the following to set local and remote folders and then get the file and exit

     cd /home/thomas/backup
     lcd /Users/thomassecondary/Projects/webapp-01\(trunk\)/Documents/sqldump

   - Get the file

     get lda_v02.sql

   - ftp will respond with something like:

     local: lda_v02.sql remote: lda_v02.sql
     229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||50724|).
     150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for lda_v02.sql (64368 bytes).
     100% |********************************************************| 64368      164.06 KiB/s    00:00 ETA
     226 Transfer complete.
     64368 bytes received in 00:00 (141.13 KiB/s)

   - Exit

     bye

   - Apply the transferred file to the database:

    mysql -u root -pOC7AaWC77B lda_v02 < ~/Projects/webapp-01\(trunk\)/Documents/sqldump/lda_v02.sql

    (Replace user/password with latest if different)
