Dark Angel

How can this be right
To Love You in this way.
To take the consequences
Pay the price I have to pay.
How can this be right
That I have to be so strong.
But when You take me with Your eyes.
I know this can't be wrong.

How can it be good
That I need Your power so much.
That I need to feel Your fingers
That I shudder at Your touch.
How can it be good
That I gave You all I had
But whenever You are with me
I know it can't be bad.

I am yearning, I am yearning
Just to be with You again.
To be taken by Your darkness
So much pleasure, so much pain.
I am trembling, I am trembling
As You return me to the light
Only wondering, Dark Angel
How can this be right.

How can this be right
And how can it be good
